<H1>Welcome to <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI">ESAPI</a></H1>

<p>The OWASP Enterprise Security API Project may be found at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI. This software
is licensed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">BSD license</a>, and we encourage 
your participation in the project.</p>

<p>ESAPI consists of two key parts, an API defined in a set of interfaces, and a reference implementation of those
interfaces. Within your enterprise, you may want to customize the ESAPI to suit the way you do business. The important
thing is that you work towards creating your ESAPI and getting all of your projects to use it. This will dramatically
increase the likelihood that your developers are producing secure code.</p>

<p>Your ESAPI can be viewed as a unified facade to all of your organization's security functionality. Have a clear, easy
to understand API make it easy to find security mechanisms and use them properly. Many of the existing security libraries,
while providing excellent security functions, are much too complex for most developers to use without mistakes. Establishing
your ESAPI will help to prevent this kind of problem.</p>

<p>Having an ESAPI has other benefits as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifed requirements</li>
<li>Easier developer security training</li>
<li>Faster and more reliable security scanning and penetration testing</li>
<li>Better results from static analysis and code review</li>
<li>Ability to change security mechanisms across applications</li>
<li>Higher assurance in your security mechanisms</li>
<li>Solid coverage of most of the OWASP Top Ten</li>
</ul>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To install the ESAPI in your environment, you should include the following jar files on your classpath:
<ul>
<li>owasp-esapi-1.0.jar</li>
<li>commons-fileupload-1.2.jar</li>
<li>commons-io-1.3.2.jar</li>
</ul>
<p>Newer versions of the Apache Commons projects may also work.</p>

<h1>Invoking</h1>

<p>The ESAPI needs to know where to find the ESAPI.properties and other configuration files. This is done by way of a Java system property.
The property should point to the resources directory where the ESAPI files reside. You can specify the system property where you invoke the JVM as follows:</p>

<pre>java -Dorg.owasp.esapi.resources="/path/to/resources/directory"</pre>

<p>You can then add calls to the ESAPI methods from your code. For example, to use the ESAPI Validator, you should
get an instance from the singleton with

<PRE>Validator validator = Validator.getInstance()</PRE>

Then you can use validation calls directly. For example, to validate an email address, you can use:

<PRE>validation.isValidDataFromBrowser( "Email", input );</PRE>

Or

<PRE>
try {
    String validEmail = validation.getValidDataFromBrowser( "Email", input );
} catch( ValidationException e ) {
    // handle bad data
}
</PRE>

<p>The regular expressions that define validators such as "Email" above are defined in the ESAPI properties file. Note
that the Validator class performs a significant amount of canonicalization work before validating and prevents
many common forms of attack.</p>

<h1>Configuring</h1>
<p>All of the configuration options for ESAPI are in ESAPI.properties. Generally the values specified there are
good options for a web application that needs to be secure.</p>

<h1>Building</h1>
<p>ESAPI is set up as an Eclipse project. If you download the full zip archive, you should be able to import it into
Eclipse and get it to compile. You should be able to run the test cases, provided that you remember that your launch
configuration for the test suite will have to have the org.owasp.esapi.resources property defined as described above.</p>
