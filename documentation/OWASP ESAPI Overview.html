<p>The OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) is both a set of
interfaces and a reference implementation of a library that provides
enterprise web application developers the most important security
functions they need in order to build web applications and web services
that protect themselves against attacks.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.owasp.org">The Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP)</a> is a worldwide free and open community focused
on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to
make application security "visible," so that people and organizations
can make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone
is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available
under an open source license. The OWASP Foundation is a 501c3
not-for-profit charitable organization that ensures the ongoing
availability and support for our work.</p>

<p>The OWASP ESAPI Project is led by Jeff Williams, <a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com">Aspect Security</a></p>

<p>You can find more information about the ESAPI project, or join
the mailing list and help us make it better from the OWASP project page
at <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI</a>.</p>

<p>The library builds on the excellent security libraries available,
such as Java Logging, JCE, and Adobe Commons FileUpload. It uses the
concepts from many of the security packages out there, such as ACEGI,
Apache Commons Validator, Microsoft's AntiXSS library, and many many
more. This library provides a single consistent interface to security
functions that is intuitive for enterprise developers.</p>

<p>Used properly, the ESAPI provides enough functions to protect
against most of the OWASP Top Ten. The only real exception is the
Insecure Communications category, which is generally outside the control
of the software developer.</p>
